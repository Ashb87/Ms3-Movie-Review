# Milestone Project Three | Movie Review

[View the live project here]() <br>

## About

This website has been created for my Milestone 3 Datacentric Development project. 
As a movie fan myself and after speaking with my mentor, I decided I would like to create a site where users can add and browse movie reviews of all genres. Using the CRUD functionality they will be able to create their own account. From here they can add, edit and delete their own reviews. As well as read the reviews from other users.

### Design

* When considering the design for this project it was important to take in to account the target audience. But very quickly I realised that a site like this doesn't really have any particulart target. Movies appeal to all people from all backgrounds of all ages. So with this in mind I wanted to create a look that just used visually appealing colors that contrast each other nicely and let all the main features of the site stand out and be clear to see for the user. 
* By giving the option to add an image to the users reviews it really helps to make the page stand out and be clear for the user which film they are reading about. 
* For the home page I wanted it to feel like an up to date movie review site so decided to add a video trailer of the biggest film out right now. I feel this instantly draws the user in and gives them the cinematic feeling all us movie fans enjoy.

  * #### Wireframes

  To create my wireframes I used balsamiq. I have done a design for both large and smaller screens to show how the layout of the site will change accordingly with different screen sizes. The links to the wireframes are below. <br>
  * [Large screens](https://github.com/Ashb87/Ms3-Movie-Review/blob/main/assets/wireframes/Movie-review-large.png)
  * [Smaller screens]() 

  The majority of the site has been kept very similar to the design of my wireframes. The main difference is on the *movie review page.* After speaking with my mentor he advised it would be better to have all the movie cards on one page with minimal information, and then open the full review for each individual review on a separate page. By doing this it has reduced the amount of scrolling needed on the movie review page as it is more condensed and much more user friendly. I also like the way the full review opens up on a separate page and think it gives a more professional feel to the site.

  * #### Imagery

  For the design of the site I have only used two images. Both quite small and only used as background images. One for the home page and one on the movie review page. For the home page it is used as the hero image and is a picture of red theatre/movie curtains. Set as a backdrop for some text. For the review page the image is used as the background for the search bar where the user can search for a movie title or genre. It has a backdrop filter over the picture to make the text stand out more making it easier for the user to read. <br>
  As well as these two images the user also has the option to add an image url so they can add a picture to their review. These are all set to a matching size with the same border radius, so that with every review added they all look the same. If the user doesnt add their own image then I have a default image set to be inserted instead, again with a matching size and border radius.
