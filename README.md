# Milestone Project Three | Movie Review

[View the live project here]() <br>

## About

This website has been created for my Milestone 3 Datacentric Development project. 
As a movie fan myself and after speaking with my mentor, I decided I would like to create a site where users can add and browse movie reviews of all genres. Using the CRUD functionality they will be able to create their own account. From here they can add, edit and delete their own reviews. As well as read the reviews from other users.

### Design

* When considering the design for this project it was important to take in to account the target audience. But very quickly I realised that a site like this doesn't really have any particulart target. Movies appeal to all people from all backgrounds of all ages. So with this in mind I wanted to create a look that just used visually appealing colors that contrast each other nicely and let all the main features of the site stand out and be clear to see for the user. 
* By giving the option to add an image to the users reviews it really helps to make the page stand out and be clear for the user which film they are reading about. 
* For the home page I wanted it to feel like an up to date movie review site so decided to add a video trailer of the biggest film out right now. I feel this instantly draws the user in and gives them the cinematic feeling all us movie fans enjoy.
